The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or simply GPL)
 is the most widely used[5] free software license. 
 It was originally written by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project.

The GPL is the first copyleft license for general use, 
which means that derived works can only be distributed under the same 
license terms. Under this philosophy, the GPL grants the recipients of 
a computer program the rights of the free software definition and uses 
copyleft to ensure the freedoms are preserved, even when the work is 
changed or added to. This is in distinction to permissive free software 
licenses, of which the BSD licenses are the standard examples.
